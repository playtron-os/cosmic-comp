  <description summary="set compositor-side backdrop color for surfaces">
    This protocol provides a way for clients to request a compositor-rendered
    backdrop color behind their surface content. The backdrop is drawn by the
    compositor between the wallpaper/background and the window content, allowing
    compositor-managed elements (such as voice orb animations) to be layered
    between the backdrop and the window.

    The backdrop color respects the surface's corner radius if set via the
    corner radius protocol.
